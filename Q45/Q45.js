// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function createCar(manufracture, model, optional) {
    return {
        manufracture,
        model,
        ...optional
    };
}
const mycar = createCar("Toyota", "Corolla", { color: "Silver", year: "2024" });
console.log(mycar);
export {};
