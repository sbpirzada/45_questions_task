// Q25: Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
//Define Variables
let alienColor = "White";
if (alienColor === "Black") {
    //Code Block
    console.log("Alien color is Black player just earned 5 points.");
}
if (alienColor === "White") {
    console.log("Alein color is White.");
}
export {};
