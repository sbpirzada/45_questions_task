// Q20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
//Making a Mountains Array 
let mountainsRanges = ["Himalaya", "Karakoram", "Kirthar", "Hindu Kush"];
//Print the Message of List
console.log("List of Mountain Ranges in Pakistan:");
//Print the values of Array in the form of list
mountainsRanges.forEach(mountain => console.log(mountain));
console.log(mountainsRanges);
